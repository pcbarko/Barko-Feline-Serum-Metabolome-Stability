The R code in this repository can be used to replicate the analysis in a manuscript that is currently under review by PLoS ONE: 

"Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals the Effects of Pre-Analytic Storage Conditions on Serum Metabolite Profiles in Cats"

The data is present in our Mendeley Data repository: 

Barko, Patrick (2022), “Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals the Effects of Pre-Analytic Storage Conditions on Serum Metabolite Profiles in Cats”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/bkw33tpg36.1
